Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr and I am learning Data Science in Skill Factory.
## Note
I will be grateful for the help and criticism of the projects. And I apologize for my English.

## Job description

It is necessary to implement the classification of spam messages using ready-made functions. 

## Quality metric

There are five tasks to be completed, each of which consists of smaller subtasks.

For each task, the template notebook shows the number of points you can get for completing it.

The maximum number of points is 11.

## What we practice

Working with Bayesian classifiers: MultinomialNB, ComplementNB.  

## Stages of the project

- download [data file](https://lms.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/3d8cb71ded70aa8810ac73aa43e85eac/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DST-3.0+28FEB2021+type@asset+block/spam_or_not_spam.zip)
- open a [notebook-template](https://lms.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/8fffc83dcc146e8256de0ae00630df80/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DST-3.0+28FEB2021+type@asset+block/SGA_unit6_NBC.ipynb) with the assignment
- the data were downloaded, analyzed and preprocessed
- algorithms were trained (MultinomialNB, ComplementNB)
- metrics are obtained
- ROC curves were plotted
- different values of the alpha parameter were selected, and a graph of the dependence of the model metric on the selected parameter was plotted

## Result

- Task completed, notebook uploaded to GitHub.
