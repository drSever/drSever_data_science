## Job description

Independently implement algorithms of stochastic gradient and coordinate descent. 

## Quality metric

- Accurate and complete tasks
- Implementation of the coordinate descent algorithm
- Scaling the columns of the original matrix
- Creating a function to calculate the root-mean-square error
- Making a naive forecast (predicting sales by an average value)
- Creating a function to get a vector of forecasts
- Creating a function to implement a stochastic gradient descent step
- Creating a function to implement stochastic gradient descent

## What we practice

Understanding and implementation of stochastic gradient and coordinate descent algorithms.  

## Stages of the project

- Download [data file](https://lms.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/be9ea3bcfb9e5ebc744c1f2af98fed61/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DST-3.0+28FEB2021+type@asset+block/Advertising.zip)
- Open a [notebook-template](https://lms.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/7b2e6cbfd22f5452704aa9c75cff644b/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DST-3.0+28FEB2021+type@asset+block/Практика_Оптимизация.ipynb) with the assignment
- Load the data and define the target variable and predictors
- Normalize the signs with which you will make the prediction
- Implement the coordinate descent, following the hints in the template file
- Implement a stochastic gradient descent, following the hints in the template file
- Evaluate the quality of both obtained models using MSE and MAE
- Draw meaningful conclusions

## Result

- Task completed, notebook uploaded to GitHub.
