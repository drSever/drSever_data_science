## Job description

We will learn the principles underlying the operation of linear regression and regression with polynomial signs. First of all, we will use the methods and functions of the Numpy library, as well as Sklearn. We will master the methods of regularization. 

## Quality metric

- the selection of traits has been made
- the linear regression model was created
- the linear regression model with polynomial features was created
- L1 and L2 regularization methods were used
- cross validation was used

## What we practice

- the selection of traits
- working with the Numpy and Sklearn library
- work with linear regression and polynomial signs

## Stages of the project

- introduction to the dataset
- creating a correlation matrix
- creating the calculation of the matrix rank and determinant
- feature selection and model building
- regularization

## Result

- Task completed, models were trained; cross validation was used, notebook uploaded to GitHub.
