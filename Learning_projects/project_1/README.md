## Job description

I am presented with data on the customer churn of a certain bank. The bank asks for my help: it wants to develop a loyalty campaign to retain customers, but to do this it needs me to find out the main reasons for customer churn. In other words, I need to establish how departing customers differ from loyal customers and how the different attributes that define customers are related to each other.

After an exploratory analysis, in order to identify the most important attributes of churn, the bank will be able to build a machine learning model that will predict customer departure. 

## Quality metric

- I will have to prepare a mini progress report in the form of a notebook, which I will provide to the mentor for review. The report should contain answers to the given questions in the form of a graph and detailed conclusions that I can draw from it.
- I can use any of the studied libraries for visualization.
- The file should contain 10 graphs - 10 answers to the tasks.
- Each graph and its transformations are performed in a separate cell.
- Under the chart, I should provide my answer to the question on it and, if required, the conclusions I can draw from the chart.

## What we practice

- The ability to work with data and transform it. 
- Ability to work with visualization libraries. 
- Ability to work with documentation for visualization libraries. 
- Adhere to the criteria for proper visualization. 

## Stages of the project

- I downloaded the data and processed it, preparing it for visualization. 
- I studied the documentation for the Plotly library (express). 
- I plotted the data, examined it, and provided descriptions and conclusions. 
- My mentor checked my work. I corrected the mistakes.

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
