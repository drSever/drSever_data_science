## Job description

In this module we are going to work with a dataset that contains information about 515,000 hotel reviews in Europe. The model we will be training is to predict the hotel rating from the Booking website based on the data available in the dataset. The exploratory analysis skills we learned will help improve the model.   

**Notes.**

## Quality metric

- Code quality (compliance with PEP-8 design standards, code commenting, README to the project). Project design on GitHub, GitLab, Kaggle.
- Data cleaning.
- Data research (quality of visualization, availability of ideas, hypotheses, comments).
- Feature generation (engineering).
- Feature selection.
- Feature transformation.
- Solution quality: the result of the MAPE metric.

## What we practice

- Create your first model based on machine learning algorithms.
- Bringing the data to the right form will be your task in this unit.

## Stages of the project

- dataset cleanup
- analysis, feature design and transformations
- data set separation
- model training
- model quality assessment
- re-working the data to improve the metric
- improve prediction quality
- win the competition at Kaggle

## Result

- Task completed, submitted on Kaggle, notebook uploaded to GitHub.
- I placed 15th in the competition with MAPE = 12.1268
- Mentor checked my work.
