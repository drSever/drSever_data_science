## Job description

There are many methods for removing noise from an image, ranging from MLPs to transformers and GANs. You and I will consider networks using autoencoders because they are much easier to train and, if compared to GAN's, the loss function is clearer.

The goal is to fill in the layers in the autoencoder sketch, run the training and get a PSNR metric result of at least 23.

## Quality metric

- fill in the layers in the autoencoder sketch
- PSNR metric result of at least 23

## What we practice

- Noise cancellation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

## Stages of the project

- download the original notebook
- error correction in the original notebook
- fill in the layers in the autoencoder sketch
- training of the model until the PSNR target is achieved

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
