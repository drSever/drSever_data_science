## Job description

It is necessary to analyse how the size of the embedding affects the quality of the model.

It is necessary to visualise the obtained result of captioning several images. Can the network performance be improved?

## Quality metric

- A visualisation of the results is provided
- An empirical analysis of the effect of embedding dimensionality on model quality was carried out, and the results are described

## What we practice

- image caption generation

## Stages of the project

- download the original notebook
- error correction in the original notebook
- training 2 different models
- visualisation and comparison of results

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
