Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr and I am learning Data Science in Skill Factory.
## Note
I will be grateful for the help and criticism of the projects. And I apologize for my English.

## Job description

Using the notebook linked above, try the following experiments:

1. Additional arithmetic. Try performing arithmetic with other features of the image, such as hair colour, or other arithmetic and see what faces are created as a result.
2. Additional interpolation. Try interpolating between three or more points in the hidden space and look at the generated results.
