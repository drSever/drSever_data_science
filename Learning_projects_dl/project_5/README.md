## Job description

In this practical task we will get acquainted with the training process, learn how to prepare data for training and choose an architecture.

Our task is to augment and correct the code so that after training the minimum quality on the validation sample is **IoU = 0.7**.
There are no restrictions - you can change the loss function, rewrite the code, data loading, models, you can take a pre-trained model (not on the same data).

The project is implemented in **Google Colab Pro**.

## Quality metric

- IoU >= 0.7

## What we practice

- practical skills in image segmentation 
- visualization skills

## Stages of the project

- booting the laptop into Google Colab
- code editing, code completion
- model training
- metric calculation 
- **IoU = 0.85**
- visualization of results

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
