## Job description

We need to use transfer learning to train the YoloV5 model on the VOC dataset and compare the results with those of Faster RCNN. 

- *VOC_project.yaml* - .yaml file for yolov5 model with dataset information    
- *metrics.py* - replace the source file in the yolov5/utils/ folder with this file.

## Quality metric

- for training and validation, the correct partitioned data presented in a suitable format for the YoloV5 model is used for training and validation
- a pre-trained model is used
- training takes place on the training sample
- accuracy on validation sample > 0.85
- the results of the model on the validation sample are visualized
- a comparison with faster rcnn is provided

## What we practice

- independent work with YOLO and Faster RCNN models
- calculation of accuracy metric in classification task
- calculation of other metrics

## Stages of the project

- dataset loading
- YOLO training
- result visualization
- conclusions
- comparison with Faster RCNN
- uploading work to GitHub

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
