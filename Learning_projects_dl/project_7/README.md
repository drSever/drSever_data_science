## Job description

You are a CV specialist at a startup and you are tasked with building a model to predict the trajectory of active space objects in order to avoid collisions with space debris. Your task is to segment images of artificial satellites and space stations, achieving a mIoU metric value **> 70%** on a validation sample.

The project was performed in Google Colab Pro (A100).

## Quality metric

- data loaded using DataLoader
- trained Instance Segmentation model of your choice
- the code is readable and clear, with relevant comments present
- mIoU > 0.70 in the validation sample
- visualization of the obtained results was performed

## What we practice

- image segmentation problem solution
- analyze the performance of algorithms using metrics specific to recognition tasks
- visualization of data and the resulting model predictions

## Stages of the project

- download and upload the dataset
- draw one batch of downloaded data
- train the Instance Segmentation model
- visualize the predictions of the model
- calculate Instance Segmentation metrics

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
