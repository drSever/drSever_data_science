## Job description

We need to manually create a LeNet-5 neural network and, using the well-known MNIST dataset, predict the classes of images with digits. Let's try to do it without training the network (weights will be initialized randomly) and after training our model.

**N.B.** We will use the GPU cores of a MacBook M1 Pro laptop for the job.

## Quality metric

accuracy on test sample > 0.95

## What we practice

- dataloader usage
- writing a model from scratch, knowing its architecture
- visualization of learning outcomes

## Stages of the project

- dataset loading
- image augmentation
- definition of training and test samples and their dataloaders
- manually writing a model and attempting to make predictions 
- prediction attempt after model training
- result visualization
- conclusions
- uploading work to GitHub

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
