## Job description

It's time to put VAE into practice! Let's train the variational autoencoder to generate a human face.
To do this, let's use the [Frey](https://lms-cdn.skillfactory.ru/assets/courseware/v1/b041c8987cf09178b0c352a1ad3af133/asset-v1:SkillFactory+DSPR-CV+ALWAYS+type@asset+block/frey_rawface.zip) dataset, which contains about 2,000 monochrome images of Brendan Frey's face. Each image is 28 pixels high and 20 pixels wide. 

The project was performed in MacBook Pro M1.
