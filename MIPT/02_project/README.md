## Job description

Vasily, the founder of Gaz-Taz-Vaz-Neft, is doing well: he already has 100 gas production wells in operation. This year he is opening 30 new wells. However, in order to optimize costs and increase income, Vasily needs to estimate how much money each of the wells will bring him, as well as to understand which factors (well parameters) will potentially have the strongest impact on gas production.

To do this, Vasily has decided to hire you as a Data Science specialist.

Vasily provides you with a [set of data](https://lms.skillfactory.ru/asset-v1:SkillFactory+MFTIDS+SEP2023+type@asset+block@_unconv.zip) on gas production from his wells.

Your task is to build a regression model that predicts the gas production of a well (target attribute - Prod) based on the other well characteristics, and to interpret the results of your model.

Let's divide this task into two parts:

- In the first, we will build a simple linear regression model, analyze its results and select the most significant factors for prediction.
- In the second part, we will build a polynomial regression model with regularization and look at the final modeling results.

## Quality metric

- complete all the tasks, obtaining the maximum number of points

## What we practice

- creation and training of a classical linear regression model, including Numpy tools
- creation and training of a linear regression model with different types of regularization (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet)

## Stages of the project

- download and data processing
- job sequencing

## Result

Tasks completed, project files uploaded to GitHub.
