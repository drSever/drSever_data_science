## Job description

To consolidate the passed material we offer you the following task: using the kaggle-environments library, which implements the functionality of interaction between virtual agents within the framework of several popular games, implement several agents by yourself and compare them in the game “rock--scissors-paper”.    

YOU NEED TO:    
Describe the behavior of a bot that will play a rock-paper-scissors game with similar bots. The bot's behavior is described using a function that takes as input information about past games. (The signature of the function is given in Google Colab, and a detailed description of the input values is available at the link)
After describing the behavior of the agents, run a tournament between them and check which strategy performs the best.
Note that you don't necessarily need to use “quality” strategies - in this task the main focus should be on diversity (i.e. agents who would play sticking to a “rock only” or “scissors only” strategy is fine).
