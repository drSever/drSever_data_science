## Job description

There will be a resume database, downloaded from the job search site hh.ru.  
Problem: Some job seekers do not specify a desired salary when they write their resume. This is a hindrance for the recommendation system of HeadHunter, which selects for job seekers a list of the most suitable vacancies, and for employers a list of the most suitable specialists.  
HeadHunter wants to build a model that automatically determines the approximate salary level that's right for a user based on the information they've provided about themselves. But, as we know, before a model can be built, the data needs to be transformed, examined, and cleaned up. That's the challenge!  

**Notes.**   
1. Due to GitHub limitations, the data file must be downloaded separately. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kb78mAWYKcYlellTGhIjPI-bCcKbGuTn/view?usp=sharing).
2. Unfortunately, GitHub does not support rendering the Plotly library. The original graphics are saved to the **plotly** directory, and will be referenced in the notebook itself. The same graphs in .svg format, which are presented in the Markdown section, are also located there.
