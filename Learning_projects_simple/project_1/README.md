# drSever Data Science SF
Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr and I am learning Data Science in Skill Factory.
## Note
I will be grateful for the help and criticism of the projects. And I apologize for my English.

## Job description

- A computer makes an integer between 1 and 100, and we have to guess it. By «guess» we mean «to write a program that guesses a number».
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether more or less than a random number of the number we need.
- Provides a baseline template from a screencast.
- Using ready-made code as well as ingenuity, it is necessary to write your function, which will cope with guessing in less than 20 attempts.
- Once the problem is solved, it is necessary to put it on GitHub, taking into account the rules of design.

## Quality metric

The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions. It is necessary to achieve a minimum number of attempts.

## What we practice

- Learning to write good code in Python.
- Learning to work with IDE.
- Learning to work with GitHub.

## Stages of the project

- I changed the source code
- I put comments in my code
- Created a file *.ipynb
- Created the README.md file
- Made additional changes to the README.md file
- I worked on the bugs after the mentor checked.

## Result

My algorithm guesses the number in an average of 8 attempts. The data is loaded on GitHub.
