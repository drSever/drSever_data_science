## Job description

Using the information on mussels of St. Petersburg and Magadan, which are represented as two arrays petersburg and magadan, it is necessary to check the data for normality and for the presence of correlation. To do this, we need to merge the two arrays into a DataFrame. Then justify your choice of test for correlation. Draw a conclusion on the hypothesis.
Also need to answer the question: What is the difference in average mussel size by producer city. We need to justify the choice of test and draw a conclusion on the hypothesis.

## Quality metric

Problem solved, correct statistical tests selected, correct conclusions formulated.

## What we practice

- Learning to write good code in Python.
- Practice choosing the right statistical tests.
- Practicing with the **scipy.stats** library.

## Stages of the project

- I was working with a study notebook.
- I modified the source code and added my.
- I have studied the theory presented in the training module.
- I created a separate notebook to do this task and uploaded and formatted it on GitHub.
- I'm waiting for my mentor to check my work.

## Result

Mentor checked my work. I did well on my assignment.
