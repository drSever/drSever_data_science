Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr and I am learning Data Science in Skill Factory.
Below are my training projects.

# My project 1

## Job description

- A computer makes an integer between 1 and 100, and we have to guess it. By «guess» we mean «to write a program that guesses a number».
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether more or less than a random number of the number we need.
- Provides a baseline template from a screencast.
- Using ready-made code as well as ingenuity, it is necessary to write your function, which will cope with guessing in less than 20 attempts.
- Once the problem is solved, it is necessary to put it on GitHub, taking into account the rules of design.

## Quality metric

The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions. It is necessary to achieve a minimum number of attempts.

## What we practice

- Learning to write good code in Python.
- Learning to work with IDE.
- Learning to work with GitHub.

## Note
I will be grateful for the help and criticism of the projects. And I apologize for my English.

## Note 2
Frankly, I do not like the solution of this problem. My code is not elegant and my inner perfectionist resents it.
